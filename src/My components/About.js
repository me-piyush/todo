      This about the to-do app.
      <p>
        The ToDo app is a user-friendly web application that enables users to
        create, view, update, and delete tasks, facilitating efficient task
        management. Users can add new tasks with titles and descriptions, view
        their task list, and mark tasks as completed or in progress. The app may
        offer additional features such as task prioritization, filtering, and
        reminders, all while persisting task data for easy access across
        sessions. With a responsive design and intuitive interface, the ToDo app
        streamlines task organization, increasing productivity and helping users
        stay on top of their daily activities.
